Python ships with built in modules. When checking dir(__builtins__), you may not see
certain functionality that you need, so in order to check the different system modules,
which you would need to import into your scripts, use (while in the interpreter)

import sys
sys.builtin_module_names

one example is the time module - to see its methods, use

import time
dir(time)

We wont have everything we need from python builtin modules, so we can also use 3rd party
modules

There is 1 exception to builtin modules - os
if you do a sys.builtin_module_names, you will NOT see os, but its There

os has lots of functionality, esepcially when dealing with system level needs.....
if you find your operating systems python3 directory, inside lib folder, there are tons of
***.py files, all of which are modules.... os is one of them
