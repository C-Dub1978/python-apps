Python ships with built in modules. When checking dir(__builtins__), you may not see
certain functionality that you need, so in order to check the different system modules,
which you would need to import into your scripts, use (while in the interpreter)

import sys
sys.builtin_module_names

one example is the time module - to see its methods, use

import time
dir(time)

We wont have everything we need from python builtin modules, so we can also use 3rd party
modules
